Introduction

At the last of Google I/O conference. Google has announced its new version of Android called Marshmallow. Google has introduced some new features. One of the biggest new feature is the management of permissions granted to applications that are downloaded from the Play Store.

Permissions

With Marshmallow, we no longer need to validate the permissions during the installation, but when using the application. the user will have the possibility to choose the permissions at the time of its use. We can now display the permissions requested by the application from the menu dedicated to the management of permissions for applications that are already installed.
